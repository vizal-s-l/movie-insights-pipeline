# Movie insights analytics pipeline

Designed and implemented a data engineering pipeline to process, analyze, and visualize user-movie interaction insights from a large dataset. Utilized SQL databases, Python data analysis libraries, and visualization tools to extract trends, user activity, and key insights from movie ratings and user data
## Objective:
Designed and implemented a complete data engineering pipeline from data ingestion to visualization with a focus on analyzing movie ratings, genres, and user activity trends.

## Tools & Technologies:
### Database: 
  MySQL (with pymysql for database connection)
### Programming Language:
  Python
### Libraries: 
  Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SQLAlchemy, pymysql
### Tools: 
  Jupyter Notebook
### Data Visualization: 
  Seaborn, Matplotlib
### ETL Pipeline: 
  SQL + Python integration for data extraction, cleaning, and transformation.

## Key Features
### Ingested & Cleaned Data: 
  Loaded raw movie datasets from CSVs into MySQL for further querying and analysis.
### Designed Insights Queries:
  Wrote SQL queries to extract user insights, trends, and movie interaction statistics.
### Visualized Data: 
  Designed visualizations like Monthly Ratings Trends, Top Movies by Ratings Count, Most Active Users, and Popular Movie Genres using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
### Analyzed Ratings Data: 
  Investigated user activity trends, monthly engagement insights, and movie popularity patterns using data analysis pipelines.

## Insights Generated
### Top 10 Movies by Average Ratings: 
  Analyzed user preferences based on average user rating data. Visualized the data using bar charts.

### Most Active Users: 
  Extracted the users most active in terms of interaction and analyzed their engagement over time.

### Most Popular Genres: 
  Derived insights on movie genres' popularity using user rating trends.

### Ratings Trends Over Time:
  Visualized yearly trends showing how the number of ratings changed over time.

## ðŸ’¼ Skills/Techniques Demonstrated
### Data Analysis & Cleaning: 
  Used Pandas to preprocess movie data and user activity data.
### SQL Query Design:
  Designed optimized SQL queries to gather data insights from MySQL database.
### ETL (Extract, Transform, Load): 
  Extracted movie insights using SQL, transformed them using Python, and loaded visualizations for analysis.
### Data Visualization: 
  Designed actionable insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
### Database Interaction with Python: 
  Leveraged pymysql to connect Python with MySQL.

## ðŸŽ¯ Impact of the Project

Transformed raw user-movie interaction data into meaningful insights.

Enabled visualization of patterns related to user activity, monthly trends, and genre popularity.

Gained experience with integrating databases, SQL queries, and Python pipelines for real-world data analysis.
